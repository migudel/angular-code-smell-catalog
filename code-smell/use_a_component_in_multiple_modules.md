# Use a Component in Multiple Modules

## Description

One of the most common —and often overlooked— mistakes in Angular is **attempting to declare the same component in multiple modules** (`NgModule`). Angular **explicitly disallows** a component from being listed in the `declarations` array of more than one module, and doing so will result in compilation errors.

This code smell points to a lack of modular organization in the project’s architecture. The proper solution is to **declare the component once in its own feature module, export it from there, and import that module wherever the component is needed**.

---

## Why This Is a Code Smell

- **Explicitly forbidden by Angular**: A component cannot be declared in more than one module. Doing so produces compile-time errors such as:
  > `Type HeroComponent is part of the declarations of 2 modules...`
- **Indicates poor architectural planning**: Attempting to reuse a component without encapsulating it in its own module.
- **Hinders scalability**: Duplication-related issues accumulate as the codebase grows.
- **Breaks modular reusability principles**: Shared components should be properly encapsulated and reusable via module exports.

## Non-Compliant Code Example

The same component is declared in two different modules:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hero',
  template: '<p>Hero works!</p>'
})
export class HeroComponent {}
```

```ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [HeroComponent],
  exports: []
})
export class HeroesModule {}
```

```ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [HeroComponent],
  exports: []
})
export class DashboardModule {}
```

---

## Compliant Code Example

Declare the component in a dedicated feature module and reuse it through `exports`/`imports`:

```ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [HeroComponent],
  exports: [HeroComponent] // Expose to other modules
})
export class SharedModule {}
```

```ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [SharedModule]
})
export class HeroesModule {}
```

```ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [SharedModule]
})
export class DashboardModule {}
```
