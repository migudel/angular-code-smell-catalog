# Nested Subscriptions

> [!Note]
> There are already two ESLint plugins focused on RxJS best practices. Specifically, this code smell is addressed by the following rules:

> - [`rxjs/no-nested-subscribe`](https://github.com/cartant/eslint-plugin-rxjs/blob/main/docs/rules/no-nested-subscribe.md)
> - [`rxjs-x/no-nested-subscribe`](https://github.com/JasonWeinzierl/eslint-plugin-rxjs-x/blob/main/docs/rules/no-nested-subscribe.md)

## Description

**Nested subscriptions** occur when one observable is subscribed to inside the callback of another subscription in Angular code.\
This leads to the so-called *callback hell* —a deeply nested, pyramid-shaped structure that is hard to read, maintain, and test.\
Moreover, it bypasses RxJS’s powerful composition model, where operators like `switchMap`, `mergeMap`, `concatMap`, and `exhaustMap` should be used instead to flatten and compose streams declaratively.


## Why This Is a Code Smell

- **Reduced readability and maintainability**: Nesting subscriptions leads to callback pyramids (*callback hell*), making control flow difficult to follow and refactor.
- **Poor error and lifecycle handling**: Errors and unsubscriptions are harder to manage when subscriptions are embedded within others.
- **Violation of reactive principles**: Ignores RxJS’s declarative and composable model, undermining its idiomatic usage.
- **Increased coupling**: Tight binding of async operations reduces modularity and increases fragility.
- **Limited data stream reuse**: Nested flows are often rigid and hard to test or reuse across components.
- **Greater risk of subtle bugs**: Nested subscriptions increase the likelihood of duplicated side effects, missed unsubscriptions, or execution order issues.

## Non-Compliant Code Example

### Consuming the first subscription (data dependency)

```ts
this.userService.getUser().subscribe(user => {
  this.orderService.getOrders(user.id).subscribe(orders => {
    this.orders = orders;
  });
});
```

### Combination of the 2 subscriptions
```ts
firstObservable$.pipe(
  take(1)
)
.subscribe(firstValue => {
  secondObservable$.pipe(
    take(1)
  )
  .subscribe(secondValue => {
    console.log(`Combined values are: ${firstValue} & ${secondValue}`);
  });
});
```

## Compliant Code Example

### Consuming the first subscription (data dependency)

```ts
this.userService.getUser().pipe(
  switchMap(user => this.orderService.getOrders(user.id))
).subscribe(orders => {
  this.orders = orders;
});
```

### Combination of the 2 subscriptions
```ts
firstObservable$.pipe(
  withLatestFrom(secondObservable$),
  first()
)
.subscribe(([firstValue, secondValue]) => {
  console.log(`Combined values are: ${firstValue} & ${secondValue}`);
});
```
